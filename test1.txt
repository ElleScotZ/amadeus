Some students save money by buying used copies of textbooks, which tend to be less expensive,
and are available from many college bookstores in the US, who buy them back from students
at the end of a term. Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased
by an off-campus wholesaler for 0â€“30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores.
Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging teachers to assign homework that
must be done on the publisher's website. Students with a new textbook can use the pass code
in the book to register on the site; otherwise they must pay the publisher to access the
website and complete assigned homework.

Students who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the
ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used
booksellers or retailers.

Most leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently
in math and science. Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions
are often not about significant improvements to the content. "New editions are to a
considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain
their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices." A study conducted by The Student PIRGs
found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of the previous edition (not
surprising if the old version is obsolete), and 58% more than a used copy of the previous
edition. Textbook publishers maintain these new editions are driven by demand from teachers.
That study found that 76% of teachers said new editions were justified "half of the time or 
less" and 40% said they were justified "rarely" or "never". The PIRG study has been criticized
by publishers, who argue that the report contains factual inaccuracies regarding the
annual average cost of textbooks per student.

The Student PIRGs also point out that recent emphasis on e-textbooks does not always save
students money. Even though the book costs less up-front, the student will not recover any
of the cost through resale.
